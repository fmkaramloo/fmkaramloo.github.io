  Before Founding SilkMinds, Mitra Karamloo worked as Operations Manager and Project Controller at various start-up companies in and out of the United States, as well as Event Manager in the non-profit sector for 12 years.

  Prior to that, Mitra had a decade of teaching experience, which sparked a life-long passion for education, as well as strengthened her dedication to fostering and growing community. She has channeled those interests in successfully executing events promoting education about Middle-Eastern culture and spirituality for nearly a decade now.
  
  Mitra has completed a post-graduate program in Business Administration through U.C. Berkeley's Extension program, has a Bachelors degree in Physics and an associate degree in Electronics.
  
  With her leadership, SilkMinds is able to raise cultural and spiritual awareness while offering artists a platform to make their work readily accessible to a broader audience.
